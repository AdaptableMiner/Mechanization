# Mechanization
Mechanization is a Minecraft datapack aimed at recreating popular tech mods like IC2 and Thermal Expansion. It has been in development for over 2 years, with the first version being released in March 2016. Mechanization has over 45 machines and 60 items with a feature set ranging from an extensive power system to custom ore generation to plasma guns. And best of all? All this with little or no noticable lag.
